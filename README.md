# Overview
the purpose of this is to make a Password Manager that stores the information in a database (Firebase / Firestore).

The user will create a master password and a user name.
Once those have been created, the user will be able to add, edit, and delete any password that is stored in the database.
The data being stored is the following:
* Password for a service (Google, Facebook, etc.)
* Service name
* Email used for service

The edit and delete options will search for a password based on the service name provided.
